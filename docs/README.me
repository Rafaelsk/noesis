# Noesis [WIP]

A logical inference machine for constructing a consistent belief system from foundational axioms.

## Vision

Noesis is a personal project designed to build a logic engine that:
- Accepts axioms, derived theorems, and proposed statements
- Ensures internal logical consistency
- Rejects anything not provable from existing foundations
- Allows REPL-style exploration and reasoning

## Current Capabilities

- [x] Add foundational statements
- [x] Propose new statements
- [x] Show all known axioms and theorems
- [x] REPL-based interaction
- [x] Pure functional core (Scala 3)
- [x] Modular architecture (core, adapter, model, logic)

## Work in Progress

- Logical inference rules (e.g. Modus Ponens)
- Proper parsing of structured logic (`A -> B`, `Â¬C`)
- JSON-based persistence
- Testing suite

**Example session:**
```bash
noesis> foundation A
noesis> foundation A -> B
noesis> propose B
noesis> show all
```
